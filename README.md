# Computer-vision
#Face Expression Recognition using CNN
#Overview
This project aims to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify facial expressions using the "Face Expression Recognition Dataset" from Kaggle. The model can recognize seven different facial expressions: angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise, and neutral.

#Setup and Installation
Install Necessary Packages: Begin by installing the required packages such as Kaggle for dataset access.

Upload Kaggle JSON for Dataset Access: Upload the Kaggle API token to authenticate and download the dataset.

#Data Preparation
Image Data Generator: Utilize ImageDataGenerator from TensorFlow Keras for data augmentation and normalization. The dataset is split into training and validation sets.

#Model Architecture
Sequential CNN Model:

Convolutional layers with ReLU activation and max-pooling.

Flattening layer to convert 2D matrices to a vector.

Dense layers with ReLU and softmax activation for classification.

#Training the Model
Compile the model with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.

Train the model on the training dataset, validating on the validation dataset over multiple epochs.

#Evaluation
Evaluate the trained model using the validation dataset to check its performance.

Metrics include accuracy and loss for both training and validation sets.

Generate a confusion matrix and a classification report to visualize model performance.

#Visualization
Plot the training and validation accuracy and loss over epochs to visualize model performance.

Functionality to display a batch of sample images with their predicted labels from the training set.

#Model Save and Load
Save the trained model for future use in HDF5 format.

#Results
Detailed results of model performance, including the confusion matrix and classification report.
